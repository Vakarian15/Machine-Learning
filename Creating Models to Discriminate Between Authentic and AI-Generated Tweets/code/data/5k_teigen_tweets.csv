Here comes mama to sell my cherries,teigen
"No idea who chef mike is but he probably wouldn’t be happy to learn that you, a friend of his worthy of calling, is outing him about his impending lawsuit.",teigen
weren’t loved enough.,teigen
Also g o r g e o u s,teigen

Also g o r g e o u s,teigen

Sometimes I’m just happy people are enjoying seasoned foods,teigen
O yes,teigen
Activity of the day was to make something super cute that you don’t even like - because kids,teigen
"and if anyone needs a lesson on how less is more, please look at the amazing Marie Kondo, who so very wisely didn't say shit through any of this.",teigen
"and if anyone is wondering why someone with 12 million followers would go private, it's because there are still a LOT of people who don't follow me who hate me, and I didn't want to see it. that's all.",teigen
"And honestly, for the past few days, every time I saw a shallot I wanted to cry, but I do appreciate this and hopefully we can all be better and learn from the dumb shit we have all said and done.",teigen
"I still think you are incredibly talented. And in an industry that doesn’t really lend itself to supporting more than a handful of people at a time, I feel like all we have are each other!",teigen
"I often comment about how I wish I could get away with what I used to, now, but the truth is, I don’t. I’ve learned a fuckton from my years being watched (& read) and I can really say it makes you a better person! It makes u think about the impact of what u say/who it might hurt",teigen
Oh! but how I still think some of those things. I just maybe don’t unleash on my peers on super public platforms lol.,teigen
"Eventually, I realized that once the relatable “snarky girl who didn’t care” became a pretty successful cookbook author and had more power in the industry, I couldn’t just say whatever the fuck I wanted. The more we grow, the more we get those wakeup calls.",teigen
"I think we are alike in so many ways. I remember the exact time I realized I wasn’t allowed to say whatever popped in my head-that I couldn’t just say things in the way that so many of my friends were saying. Before, I never really knew where I stood in the industry, in the world",teigen
"I don’t agree with the pile-on, ppl waiting with bated breath for apologies, deciding if that apology is good, the ppl who say u were right & never needed to in the first place - there are so many different types in this kind of situation & tbh, I just want it to be over",teigen
"thank u for this, @alisoneroman. To be clear, it never once crossed my mind for u to apologize for what you genuinely thought! The comments stung, but they moreso stung because they came from u! It wasn’t my usual news break of some random person hating everything about me!",teigen
I have too much to say and no room,teigen
let's try again,teigen
whoops haven't tweeted for so long,teigen
"This is what always happens. The first day, a ton of support, then the next, 1 million reasons as to why you deserved this. It never fails.",teigen
"I really hate what this drama has caused this week. Calling my kids Petri dish babies or making up flight manifests with my name on them to “Epstein island”, to justify someone else’s disdain with me seems gross to me so I’m gonna take a little break.",teigen
well done on both the bread and the butter!,teigen
"me, John and luna will be on the @baby2baby instagram account icing cookies in a bit to talk to @nicolerichie and hopefully raise a little bit of money for their incredible organization!",teigen
she is getting pretty good with hair! Wants to own a salon. Nails and hair twisting only. No cuts or color!,teigen
Well it happened again. How could you call this a jello mold??,teigen
beautiful!!!! what did you make!? looks so good!,teigen
Would absolutely subscribe to a newsletter!!,teigen
Yay shank uuuu!!!,teigen
It’s moments like those I’m never quite sure people will remember. But seeing you do makes me so happy!!,teigen
"I didn’t think it was possible to love you more. My heart!!! your words will be framed. Thank you, chef.",teigen
 thank u sir,teigen
Lol! <3,teigen
"You tagged me so the stars don’t really work, @isa*elslo*e",teigen
"It’s okay, girl. Don’t feel bad.",teigen
good to know.,teigen
Ah thank you ,teigen
"it’s my hands passing it to another pair of hands. It doesn’t “have to happen”! I see, touch, use and feel everything in my line before it hits shelves.",teigen
 that makes me so happy. Thank you!!,teigen
 ,teigen
real tears!,teigen
Obsessed with her still and was obsessed with your site still!! Would give anything for it to come back!!,teigen
I’m gonna cry (really),teigen
 thank you I really appreciate that and you remembering that!,teigen
It helped me through mine as well! That’s why all of this started. And prob why it hurts so much. I do this because it makes you annnnd me happy.,teigen
I tried to read this to john and had to stop to cry one sentence in,teigen
"anyhow. now that that's out there, I guess we should probably unfollow each other @alisoneroman",teigen
"there are many days I cry very hard because cravings, the site, is our baby we love to pump content onto. we do this work ourselves, and there is NO monetary gain yet. it is just work work work and the reward is you liking it. so to be called a sellout....hooooo it hurts",teigen
It has been crappy to deal with this all day but I couldn't not say something. I know the actual tears I put into the work I do and it's really hard to see someone try to completely invalidate it. Someone I really liked.,teigen
"I don't think I've ever been so bummed out by the words of a fellow food-lover. I just had no idea I was perceived that way, by her especially. And Marie, too. Marie is awesome.",teigen
"I genuinely loved everything about Alison. Was jealous she got to have a book with food on the cover instead of a face!! I've made countless NYT recipes she's created, posting along the way.",teigen
to see that thing in my hand being used by people around the world makes me so happy. Watching a company grow makes me happy. I get joy from it and lots of people do.,teigen
"I didn't ""sell out"" by making my dreams come true. To have a cookware line, to get to be a part of that process start to finish, to see something go from sketch to in my hands, I love that.",teigen
"I started cravings because I wanted something for myself. I wanted something John didn't buy, I wanted something to do that calmed me, made me happy and made others happy, too. Cravings isn't a ""machine"" or ""farmed content"" - it's me and 2 other women.",teigen
"this is a huge bummer and hit me hard. I have made her recipes for years now, bought the cookbooks, supported her on social and praised her in interviews. I even signed on to executive produce the very show she talks about doing in this article.",teigen
I dunno who sent me this sourdough kit with sourdough starter already done but THANK U!,teigen

"Love island has evolved so much since the early days. No more chain smoking or drunken cries. Or sex! They seem much more aware that they are, indeed, on tv",teigen
love island question: is a scaffolder someone in construction generally or someone in purely the construction of scaffolding? Also why are all your scaffolders young perfect Ken dolls,teigen

Lots of people making this lately!! ,teigen

hey are you okay,teigen
I only know cause I don’t have an indoor pool lol,teigen
Eating outside is literally a caption of MISS THESE DAYs,teigen
Watching influencers go out of their way to post hot pics of themselves but also having to caption how they “miss these days” for fear of being yelled at is magical,teigen
A recipe that dates back to the first few months of my Wordpress blog many many years ago!,teigen

like I should probably be out with john enjoying life at the Clive Davis party. but I don’t wanna accidentally tell someone a song sucks and then learn they wrote it. I can’t live that way anymore,teigen
!!!,teigen
I think the reason I don’t go out very much is because it leaves less room for me to feel bad about something I said or did the next day. You can’t be annoying or dumb if no one ever gets to hang out with you!! These are my tips. Yes I’ve seen therapists why do you ask,teigen

Just giving you a company perspective! But I very much also think everyone in the world deserves free ice cream,teigen
"hear this a lot and I know it really seems like that and you are very right but companies know I’ll post or talk about it and for an actual commercial I’d normally get very paid to do, they get it for free because it’s literally just a tub of ice cream or a silly hot sauce bottle",teigen

"John went to Nigeria for a couple days and I thought about going, purely to find Michael from 90 days, but...the enchilada has rendered me useless",teigen
it kind sucks that I got so impassioned about this when it was a simple bone broth tweet but it really comes from a place of everyone right now discrediting anything they can and it hurts my feels as a crazy person willing to love anything that makes me feel good!,teigen
I love the sag awards. Everyone gets to wear their 3rd favorite dress,teigen
I agree. I am a firm believer in taking your god damn medicine and anything else on top of that is whatever tickles your pickle,teigen
grammy’s in one week. should i go or will my body continue rejecting the enchilada I ate days ago,teigen
...I don’t think so but maybe. But it’s not just about this. I’m venting!,teigen
anyhoo. I know you’re the doc. I’m just the patient. I have no stake in selling these things that make me feel better. It just hurts to be told you’re wrong or crazy or naive when something so small made my life exponentially better. Everyone should have that feeling.,teigen
"Someone would grab my hand, I bruised. My blood was thin and weak. I needed that fat, that marrow, that hot feeling of relief and comfort to sleep! Could I have eaten a steak? I didn’t have the energy",teigen
"Bur back to your original topic: most broths suck and are capitalizing on the trend. But it hasn’t been a trend for many people around the world, it’s a common way of healing and life (especially asia) - I remember waking up just trembling, bruised from even the gentlest hugs",teigen

"Mentally, it was lexapro. And my time doing silly things that gave me a moment to be calm and reflect. Things you find incredibly stupid. But things that worked for me. Because this mental health thing isn’t just about studies. Human beings need nurture and care and healing",teigen
"Real bone broth is rich with marrow and deep flavor. Chicken stock is...water. When i was suffering horribly from post partum depression, I was covered in bruises, had no energy and no ability to sleep. I attribute much of the physical aspect of getting better to bone broth.",teigen
yes and the tomato explosion,teigen
That’s why I got two bulldogs,teigen
yea maybe it’s the eggs lol,teigen
I wake up for at least a half an hour like 4 times a night,teigen
I can’t sleep without being overly full. I take two hard boiled eggs to bed every night and eat them when I randomly wake up. It used to be beef jerky but I’d wake up too puffy,teigen
"oh but I love this, it’s my happy treat when I go. beans at 9am is special for me",teigen

I was always so nervous. I never knew what I was gonna do next. I still don’t really know. But it’s okay. Don’t just survive. Live!,teigen
"I don’t hide anything. I fight in cars, I fight at home, I fight at the airport. I don’t care. John just won’t fight back.",teigen
No it’s good though! And I know how stupid it sounds to even say celebrity. It’s just...I dunno. It’s why I love twitter so much. I can talk and connect with people without feeling weird or uncomfortable. Like you guys are really my friends.,teigen
 ,teigen
I really do!!! ,teigen
scheduling. he will tell me something he knows I didn’t hear and get mad when i am confused later. “Hey I’ll take Luna to school today also I’m going to Washington DC next week”,teigen

no you start to know and have relationships with a lot of people. and I used to do them so I feel for them! it is NOT EASY,teigen
"luna hates them. in New York they don't really hide and they apologize when she freaks and stop photographing. here in LA, they've learned to hide more and you don't know you're being photographed. I'd rather know.",teigen
"BUT one time, a guy in nyc shot directly into a dressing room I was changing in. I memorized his face and still hate him.",teigen

one person on lip sync battle rubbed me in an extremely wrong way ,teigen

"unbelievably boring and you are pulled in 100 different directions and yelled at to sit down. the bar is never close to you and everyone is so mean to seat fillers, I dunno why anyone wants to do it",teigen
Depends! Some places are notorious for beach photos and I’m super paranoid but there’s nothing that can be done even if you have security. Some resorts call photogs. It sucks. But whatever it’s life!,teigen

you do it all for the odds. 100 no's will get you one yes. and they already know what they want before you get there. you don't wanna be a part of something they don't want anyhow.,teigen
"yes but no one really reads their own shit. and you don't wanna bring people down. unless it's a big garbage story, then you reach out to see if they're okay",teigen
a lot of people change often but mine has been the same for a long time,teigen
money,teigen
they could not care less,teigen
sometimes I ask a publicist for someone's info to text but for the most part I don't talk to many people because I don't want them to think I'm a thirsty weirdo.,teigen

"I say ""why did I wear that"" or ""why did they cut it down so much""",teigen
"maybe 10 years or so. I uber a lot, though.",teigen

John sets an alarm but leaves it in the bathroom while he makes the kids pancakes and I have to get up to cancel it. I get very upset.,teigen
"no one gives my kids nasty looks on the plane. if anything, they're creepily nice and it is crazy unfair because they are just as annoying as other kids on a plane",teigen

"aw man, awesome kid and awesome parenting. we all hope for kids like this!",teigen
NO BIG DEAL!!!!,teigen
Lmaooooo,teigen
That’s it that’s all I have,teigen
flashback to better times,teigen
"hello, mayor here, sometimes stuff u say just bombs. there is no need to get sad and paranoid about it",teigen
but did you see the part where people googled him and found out he literally killed a woman of color and got two years probation for hit and run?,teigen
"40 dollars a night, no talking or eye contact, in and out, can grab a drink and snack on your way out",teigen
lmao. this is wonderful,teigen
now hiring: someone to lift my weighted blanket onto my body,teigen
beautiful,teigen
"142,000 followers. Guys!!!!!! ",teigen

He stole your idea!!,teigen
"what’s happening, you ask?",teigen
It’s still all me!! I just pay a lot more,teigen
I’ve started another Instagram account in anticipation of my new website!! Or in anticipation of my new website I have started a new Instagram account??? It is CRAVINGSBYCHRISSYTEIGEN on there so please follow it I beg you,teigen
"prob cause we are like, two different people who make different decisions and both are great for us",teigen
“THIS IS SOMEHOW ABOUT JUST US”,teigen
Turkey bacon fried rice is a winner WHO KNEW,teigen
I like to remove half the crust sides with my teeth and enjoy the gummy fruit separately,teigen
They are at their craziest and most loving only when I am on an important call!!!! Then I spend the next 8 hours begging them to hug me,teigen
Thank u!!!! We parents appreciate u ,teigen
omg I don’t follow you guys for your LOGIC I need yes people!!!!!,teigen
I’m gonna have the noodles. Thank you,teigen
I’m not fucking around here. Please help me. I know deep down I want the noodles,teigen
"Actually I only have one fruit by the foot, one fruit roll up, and a large bowl of noodles",teigen
I can’t sleep until I have one of these options,teigen
What is worse for you health wise? Two fruit by the foots or one cup of noodles,teigen
This is me ALL DAY with miles. He is absolutely crazy,teigen
"Luna bought a locket today and told me to open it, put a kiss in and close it fast so the kiss doesn’t leave. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck. My heart",teigen
"Robert Lax - my FATHER, you bastard",teigen
you can drink as long as it’s at the house and you LEAVE. YOUR. KEYS.,teigen
true parenting is the last .3 seconds of this video,teigen
"I said “proper” yesterday too, I can’t stop",teigen
wraparound glasses,teigen
Yeah well literally no one else does so it’s pretty cool ,teigen
Every other brand I work for would kick me in the face. “FOR TWO YEARS YOU ARE NOT TO BE SEEN DRINKING ANY OTHER DRINK EVER. WE ARE ALL YOU KNOW NOW”,teigen
I very much work for Hulu but what I love about working with Hulu is that they’re very okay with me also watching and talking netflix. Hulu is awesome and not many other companies (actually I can’t think of one) allow this kind of banter.,teigen
this is...spot on,teigen
Dear god I thought I was crazy,teigen
"if I don’t have the captions on, I might as well cut my ears off. I’d be completely lost",teigen
poscast! a piece of shit podcast,teigen
What does pied off mean,teigen
"Not only do I need captions for Love Island UK, I need them to be bigger and I need to be able to play the show at half speed like a poscast. help @hulu I want to understand",teigen
"I just never thought of him as a senior employee. things have changed now I dunno if we can group chat anymore. He is too powerful, too sexy",teigen
Wait u are a senior employee? sexy ,teigen
how sad if we cheat ... with each other,teigen
when u wanna pretend u have no kids or husband for a sec,teigen
I have peaked at this very moment,teigen
Watching again,teigen
"On my 29th viewing of “dear Zachary” - if you’re coming over and haven’t seen it, this is what we are watching. I am terrible",teigen
"I have tears in my eyes all day, ready to go. This sums it up so well. I’m sorry you feel this way, too. It will get better ",teigen
this is true,teigen
dammit it’s gotta be a too-real parody. I fell for it!,teigen
lol who the fuck are you?,teigen
also us this morning,teigen
"In his defense, it was like the 9th time I made it that day. he liked it the first couple times!!",teigen
uhhhh I’ve literally watched people get their entire fuck on in an airplane movie. Like full doggy but no lesbian kissing is a rule? Lame,teigen
AND he had to fly on his least favorite airline. That is love,teigen
"I do not normally brag about john, as it is my schtick to make fun of him always, but he flew from London to LA instead of London to DC to have dinner with me and watch love island UK because I haven’t been feeling like myself lately. Just a few hours but it meant a lot. Thank u",teigen
I’ve never seen the words “passes away” in reference to a notorious serial killer. I think I prefer “is dead”,teigen
"But also, I’m glad you are having fun, I really am. I’ve just never seen one THIS LONG",teigen
Also acceptable: night before Halloween. Because there is a lot on Halloween. But from LAST WEEK TIL NOW??? No!!! No,teigen
You know when my Halloween party night is? Halloween.,teigen
I have never seen a longer Halloween in my life.,teigen
I feel fuzzy now! It’s all good I was being bitchy too. For the record it’s an absolutely terrible show,teigen
Me too this is stupid. I am sorry to see u go I’m sorry I’m all over the place but therapy is helping,teigen
"well my last name isn’t Teigan, now is it",teigen
"Kindness costs nothing, kimberly",teigen
wow huge feeling off loss over here,teigen
Every time a guy comes out they have a bigger gauge ear hole than the last. I’m really worried about the end of the season ear hole situation,teigen
It’s better and worse. Like so much worse but better,teigen
"I don’t know what that means but im gonna say worse, which I also don’t even know how u should take",teigen
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck @jenatkinhair and @mrmikerosenthal for making John and I watch love island UK. I...I love it. God dammit i can’t be held captive to another show. I need to take care of my kids,teigen
I delete recent stupid tweets when I buckle into a flight so the last one isn't in the story when we crash and die. I barely think about the death part. just the article.,teigen
WHO on earth would even have the balls,teigen
I remember that! Lol,teigen
Really? I feel like it’s sadder,teigen
I cried a tear at 1:06. I’m a wreck lately,teigen
"If I bring candy to your neighborhood and give it to u before, will you hand it to my kids and pretend today is Halloween",teigen
"Any neighborhoods do trick or treating early for kids? By early I mean like, the 30th",teigen
"walker, Twitter ranger",teigen
lmao,teigen
the fuck is walnut sauce,teigen
fucking. weirdos. https://twitter.com/taitai78787/status/1187501133641596928,teigen
Lol,teigen
"“I DO NOT, NO! But sometimes....”",teigen
I’m scared to become friends with @AOC and have her even ask me why I was late. I’m crumbling,teigen
No I posted her as a hot dog which is also a q symbol. My Snapchat emoji was a pizza. Get it right!!,teigen
We started picking a word of the night during dinner and asking google to play us the word! last night was “applesauce” and your song popped up. we loved it! ,teigen
"It was happening before for a while - I think posting my kid’s Halloween costumes may have started it. But shit hit the fan when our flight got turned around. Which uh, had nothing to do with us, and that i literally live tweeted. Why I would “live tweet” me being a pedo, I dunno",teigen
yes so imagine the INSANITY when I posted my daughter in a Halloween hot dog costume HOOOOOOOOboy it was a SIGN,teigen
yeah that has proven not to be true. I can’t ignore them. They aren’t trolls. They believe my husband and I traffick kids. I have pictures of them in my garage. I don’t think you know the magnitude of this - it’s not an “ignoring” type situation,teigen
lol can u guys even begin to comprehend the exhaustion,teigen
Like someone there is a chicken scratch list of with “epStEin FLIGHT loGs” and wrote down jon + crissy and now they all believe this.,teigen
"You ask me this every day, multiple times a day and I’m going to say it one last time. Just for you: They AREN’T, you fucking weirdo. Why do you believe ANYTHING?",teigen
"they’ve taken to Instagram! most Q people are trumpers. But the Michael Jackson Q people, oh, they exist too and let me tell you, it’s almost weirder.",teigen
I haven’t seen E.T.,teigen
I’m just getting word it is in fact David Chang’s show,teigen
"MY NEW SHOW BREAKFAST, LUNCH AND DINNER STARRING ME AND WITH APPEARANCES BY @DAVIDCHANG OUT NOW ON @NETFLIXFOOD!!",teigen
"I’ve been exposed. I have 3 photos with Harvey at parties from the past 13 years. Now I run a hollywood pedo ring. Honestly beautiful wonderful Patricia, save yourself. These people are sick. I love you too much!",teigen
C’est moi,teigen
"Not tweeting about it because I’m terrified and avoiding it. Tweeting about it because I’m so nervous. You guys have an answer for everything. Dumbfuck detectives, activate!",teigen
Yep crazy nervous over here.,teigen
NOOOOOOoooOOOOO,teigen
wow top chef much,teigen
I don’t even know how to explain it. Just tell her everyone in the world wants to fuck Helen and I pray one day i am Helen,teigen
two retweets lmao we are all we have,teigen
#over30tiktoksnotevenontiktok,teigen
EVERYONE WANTS TO FUCK HELEN ALWAYS,teigen
literally 2 people will get this and it’s me and John,teigen
John and I are gonna be the only people on tiktok with “the affair” references,teigen
"I was just gonna make a joke about “the affair” but John told me not to because no one watches it but us. then I was like well u saying that is more controversial than my original tweet about everyone wanting to fuck helen so I will just post that, which is now this",teigen
so badass. killing life.,teigen
omg lol,teigen
nope it’s real life and it’s hell,teigen
Well it is,teigen
"This is what kills me. If it were just me that got it, fine. But they leech onto every conversation, no matter the topic. They write my friends, my family, the people I follow from 90 day fiancé. What in the fuck",teigen
"Loving the very conscious word choices now. Didn’t put words in your mouth. Have it all here. Goodnight, sick darling.",teigen
"Oh so I’m also a pedo for hating the president and calling him a pussy ass bitch. that’s what it really comes down to. you wouldn’t give two fucks about any of this if I supported trump. it’s so fucking beyond odd, your delusions.",teigen
Ok. Expose it already and enough with the fucking “SOON” shit so you can leave me and my family the fuck alone,teigen
Now you get to talk about how crazy I am. Because you finally cracked me. Congrats.,teigen
"If I say so? There is really no helping you people. I’ve really tried with you. Just go now. I hope through this you’ve at least seen you’re talking to a real life breathing human being that has to read, from you and your people, that I molest fucking kids all day.",teigen
I can’t fucking win. And I don’t want to anymore. Can you imagine being in my shoes for a minute? I have a life and a family. What you do to me is sick but I’m still aware enough to know it’s not as horrible as what you think is really happening. And what IS happening.,teigen
"I don’t understand the “Hollywood is a driving force in the market” part. I want to say that isn’t true but the truth is, no one KNOWS if it’s true. So I won’t. My old tweets are just that and they were always in reference to something else you guys want to take out of context",teigen
"Yeah. We fucking aren’t. But when you tweet it with conviction, I guess we are.",teigen
A cop out to acknowledge it happens everywhere? What can I do to satisfy you? It seems like nothing and you know it. And what do you mean “if”? Human trafficking IS happening all around us. And the right people fucking care.,teigen
SCREENSHOTTING THIS INCREDIBLY SARCASTIC TWEET IN CASE IT GETS DELETED,teigen
"this type of shit happens EVERYWHERE. right fucking next to YOU. It’s ALL terrible. You think this is restricted to Hollywood?? You leave your fucking house more than I do, I promise.",teigen
Oh my god. Jesus take me now,teigen
Currently rolling in a ball in front of me!,teigen
I swear to god i will do this one at a fucking time. I am so done.,teigen
"TELL ME. go the fuck on, by all means. Keep fucking going.",teigen
All good. I know. I’m just so fucking tired of this shit. Not defending yourself doesn’t work. Defending yourself doesn’t work. I’d rather get to talk.,teigen
"If I go out, I take 10-20 pics with random people a day/night. I don’t know what the fuck they’re up to. I think I saw Harvey 3 times in 14 years, out and in public only. But they use this, over and over and over.",teigen
“I’m sorry. We didn’t know. We wish we could take it back with what we know now” does not work for these people. this wasn’t done in secrecy. What do you want from us. It’s a photo. A 1 second in time party pic they use over and over and over to accuse us of molesting children.,teigen
Lol yes! I love sport,teigen
whaaaat,teigen
 ,teigen
it makes me so happy to know people really thought I saw Lebron James at an embroidery shop in downtown LA with a blank jersey,teigen
I feel like maybe it was a livestream or something. But it’s gone!! my kids will never believe me,teigen
I really appreciate anyone who remembers this. I can’t find the exact tweets,teigen
 the good ol days,teigen
lmao I forgot about this https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/jenniferabidor/this-chrissy-teigen-scoop-about-lebron-james,teigen
people forgot already!! (I did),teigen
https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1186864612903272448,teigen
"Man. My postmate went all the way into the grove to get me a wetzel’s pretzel. 1000 stars, didn’t think that would get accepted. Like asking for a dole whip from Disneyland",teigen
Why back down now? You’ve been mentioning me with her all day. I’m not blind. I see your tweets. You believe this too. Don’t bitch out now.,teigen
"Sorry you think you’ve been able to hide behind a tiger woods avi all this time. this accountability thing goes both ways. by all means, say more.",teigen
"I think you’re the one backing off a bit now, no? I do love that you just do not know when to stop. Oh, it’s grand.",teigen
"Here’s what’s gonna happen now, because I know your type so well. You’ll screen grab this and whine to crokin, and she will post it on her deranged Instagram. Your beliefs about me will heighten and the cycle continues. Do it. Fuck you. Fuck all the way off.",teigen
so you’re calling me a pig now and not a pedophile? Just confirming. Pig is fine.,teigen
Yeah now a photo of her is hanging in my garage because she is deranged and dangerous. Don’t worry. I’m saving everything including this.,teigen
sorry you’re tagged in all this lol. I’m fucking over it today,teigen
"he’s not gonna fuck you, sweetie",teigen
Oh wowee zowie a burn and a half,teigen
"Oh no, I mean me personally. I would take them off and spoon my poop like an animal",teigen
"I agree. This is thicker and curlier, I dunno why they say angel hair!",teigen
Thank u!! Good to know!,teigen
Let me know!,teigen
That is so kind but I have so much! thank you though!,teigen
"this was me, all the time. Look how I turned out! (not sure)",teigen
"u better change your username for this day, buddy",teigen
no,teigen
the standards....are low lol,teigen
"I know this sounds crazy, but this is actually the most rational response I've gotten from a Q person. I'm not upset by it. if you believe all this, this is a legitimate question/statement.",teigen
that is quite literally all you say. all day. I see it. all day.,teigen
"good one, dork",teigen
"I really love you guys. I am okay I swear!! There is so much good here, in you, and it is why I stay!! You are quite literally my world. Your friend Chrissy has just HAD IT UP TO HEREEEEEE today",teigen
"Every. Day. And when i do inevitably die, they’ll believe they got me.",teigen
er wanting* lksglksdjglsd,teigen
"like the past 6 months or so I've been feeling so buttoned up, not wanted to talk about anything because it just makes it worse. I feel like myself again!",teigen
"nah it's ok please don't be - I think I'm just venting and bringing it to light. like life is good but this is really bad, you know? I'm happy and lucky in literally every other way",teigen
I can tell when people know I'm losing my mind on twitter and they casually text me funny or nice things without addressing that I'm going absolutely apeshit. I see u and I love u,teigen
"twitter has honestly done an awesome job with filtering and blocking or if necessary, suspending accounts. instagram is not so good. but I'm not really content anymore with just...not seeing it. I wanna see it and I want to fight this shit.",teigen
"imagine this, all day every day, on every platform. defending yourself, and that defense just meaning you're getting worried. this is the exact type of person I am flooded with all day, every. fucking. day.",teigen
"honestly you guys are so normal and rational that I know it's hard to really understand it. it's easy to say ""just block and report"" - I literally have to have pics of some of these people in my garage because they live nearby",teigen
"I saw all this KNOWING they will never be like ""oh man, that Chrissy, she's a little too defensive. maybe she ISN'T a pedophile"" - I know it'll get worse. I don't care anymore. I'm not tiptoeing around your delusions anymore.",teigen
I’m honestly not positive if Q Is my boss or i am Q or they are Q,teigen
"I literally literally don’t know what this means you absolute fucking nutcase pigfuck. What have you cracked here, sherlock",teigen
"and then one day I’ll die, they’ll say it was Q and that’s my life.",teigen
Thank u so much Connor! means a lot,teigen
oh my god you’ve solved it! A tweet mocking a disgusting comment about a story ON SOMEONE ELSE. fucking Sherlock,teigen
The best is when these sick losers are like “LOOK!! She’s rubbing it in all our faces!!! Q is COMING!!” *Q never comes* THERE SHE GOES AGAIN!!!!! With the SYMBOLS!!! Someone do a movie on these pathetic NUTCASES I beg you,teigen
"It blows my mind that ppl think our flight was turned around so we could be arrested (no) then when we got to HK and my card declined, I would publicly admit to looking for work because my pedo dreams were shattered. Why would I be so out about my schemes? Fucking losers good god",teigen
I should. Maybe cinco,teigen
also this,teigen
today’s mood:,teigen
Love you so ,teigen
I REALLY AM I’ve had it,teigen
that WOULD be crazy! can you imagine?,teigen
no I'm so curious about these people now. I would like to talk. I would love to hear it!,teigen
ok! where are you thinking?,teigen
@LBrovarnik hi I know we can't talk about yesterday but I love you!,teigen
but WHY not? shishito guy?? only excuse that I'm accepting,teigen
I am writing this stuff mostly for me to remember. maybe I should get a notebook,teigen
I meant love for the second appreciate. I have no brains today!! <3,teigen
"I really appreciate that, girl! thank you. I appreciate you always!!!",teigen
what if I roasted halves of butternut squash with honey and herbs and made a crumble out of honey bunches of oats and you just ate it with a spoon,teigen
It’s uno leche tho,teigen
God I hope I was pregnant,teigen
MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm,teigen
inclined. I dunno my word choice here very off today,teigen
"you can technically eat it with your hands, like u can with anything else in the world if you're so compelled",teigen
"I want to make a cookie that you soak in sweet cream right after baking, is iced and topped with salty sweet nuts and have to eat with a fork. question: is what I'm making a cake",teigen
"He didn’t even flinch. The chimes sound like glass shattering. Boys are wild, man.",teigen
"the end, I’m crying",teigen
"Maybe since I’m using them with really rich and heavier things (stews, ramens) I don’t notice it. I don’t think I’d ever toss them with cheese and lemon or something. But now I wanna try....",teigen
"I think they have fettuccini, spaghetti, a...rice shaped one. Anyhow I get them online or at Whole Foods and they may or may not change your life.",teigen
I use this angel hair one under curries and in porky ramen broths. I truly love the chewy texture of it (I know that isn’t normally a compliment) - the only weird part is rinsing them before using! But they’re ready to heat and go after,teigen
ok time to tell you about another current obsession I am NOT getting paid for....SHIRATAKE MUSHROOM NOODLES. let me be clear there is no 100% perfect carby noodle replacement (and there shouldn’t be!!) but THESE ARE GREAT AND DELICIOUS IN THEIR OWN WAY,teigen
NO!!!!!!!,teigen
I hate myself today!!!! I am go aggro!!!!,teigen

"cannot imagine sitting on the computer, jerking it to maga models, just waiting for someone, anyone to say anything, anything u can shit on. ""oh shit she tweeted about tea HOW DO I MAKE THIS ABOUT TRUMP and what a fucking absolute tool I am""",teigen
"Get help, pigshit.",teigen
"Anyhoo again, this is not an ad. I just can’t shut up about it. If you come to my house, you are hearing about this tea. There are so many flavors and it’s gotten me to drink less horrible shit!",teigen
"Last night I had the strawberry shortcake tea and aaaaah, so maach like. And there’s a thai iced tea sprinkle tea thing by the same brand. And and and the lemon ginger. Already sweet and ready to go",teigen
"I can’t stop telling everyone i interact with about this tea. I think maybe my mind is blown because I’ve always been staunchly against tea most my life. I have no stake in this and do not know the people behind it but DAMN, I love it",teigen
"I've spent over 13 years of my life trying to bread fried chicken in varying proportions of parmesan and pork rinds, herbs and spices. when I get it to stick, this will be my legacy",teigen
ooo thank you!,teigen
what is wrong with you? do you think you're being funny? is this how you wanna be online? genuinely curious why you would want to be like this. I'm in an understanding mood.,teigen
"I was going for less carbs, my ultimate goal always. my family holds 1 carb like everyone else holds 60",teigen

I dunno can 17 year old me still get down in a potato maze,teigen

"I can't tell what song is really in the ""joker"" steps scene and what you've manipulated. I can't decide if I care",teigen
anyhow when I am sad or bored I like to log onto instagram live so the alert freaks out my publicist so I'm just gonna do that all day. miley got them all on edge,teigen
"anyhow that is my morning rant. fuck you, fucking miserable Q shitfucks, you absolute fucking losers",teigen
I have a love justice yes,teigen
"I have a love justice. when people do wrong, I need them to know they're wrong. this isn't a good or bad thing, but it's me/. the fact I have to learn to let people get away with shit like this is insane to me. it makes me ill inside. yep, they're just crazy! don't worry bout em!",teigen
"it's not just weirdos in random towns. these people are all over. I hate what some people have become and what social has done for this kind of reach. it sucks. and now they'll post this too, and it'll get even worse. I'm just so fucking tired.",teigen
"I had a real life before this. I mean...going to the grocery store and shit, parks alone with my kids. now I have a list of people in my area who genuinely believe we are in a pedo ring that is always *ALMOST* about to be exposed",teigen
"if I take legal action, it gets worse because then, to them, it's true and I'm trying to ""silence"" them. It's on posts about anything. Random 90 days fan pages, meme accounts, anything. Even if the content is normal, the comments are....this shit.",teigen
"u know what is not great? I still have to read on social media many times a day that John and I are pedophiles and look at photoshopped/miscaptioned photos of us on ""Epstein Island"" and I just have to deal with it because ""people are crazy these days""",teigen
"Please keep this setup, im coming over",teigen

"good morning, friend",teigen
Just did our first day of #CHRISSYSCOURT holy shit it’s better than I could have ever imagined - #QUIBI I fucking love you. Thank you for letting us be insane,teigen
did a whole google campaign and really use this thing ever day. never once was a told there was a volume button on the side,teigen
I live very close to there! It’s on,teigen
grandma legend in town! making some honey mustard salmon and roasted broccoli,teigen
I honestly forgot about that. It’s been so long!!,teigen
I’m a little sick and everyone asking me if I want soup. I do. I’m getting recommendations of Nate and Al’s and Greenblatt’s for chicken noodle but i prefer more veggies. Is there another chicken soup place in LA I need to know about? I know those two are GREAT yes!,teigen
"holly and michael both had the same maturity level, always!! I think they go to sandals a lot",teigen
“what are you”,teigen
"I don’t think they ever get married, thus no divorce!",teigen
Actually you know what? Phyllis and Bob are def still together. Dwight and Angela still together. Michael and Holly definitely together. Mathematically (i got a C+) SOMEONE here has to be divorced. It’s Jim and Pam.,teigen
wait what !!!!,teigen
They never went to Austin. You know it and I know it. I talk about moving to Austin every other day and here I am. Not in Austin,teigen
I don’t think they did I think that was another great idea that never happened!!,teigen
Pam is unhappy but content with their income and children so she’s like whatever and draws things for Etsy like cozy home signs (wait is this me),teigen
I think they’re together but Philly Jim likes a taste of the high life and bottle service with athletes and Pam still can’t figure out her phone so he never has to answer FaceTimes and he never gets caught,teigen
"guys I’m loving your endless love optimism here but I didn’t ask what you HOPE for, I asked what you actually think!!",teigen
"It has been 10 years since Jim and Pam got married. Do you think they are still together, separated, divorced or open marriage",teigen
Sitting on this stoop was one of the greatest moments of my life. The entire day was glee and magic. Thank you to our heroes at @sesamestreet!,teigen

"when I had zero babies I wanted 4. Then 1, I wanted 3. Then 2, I’m good with 2. just posting this to look at when I’m pregnant with my third",teigen
"I got the long, flat ones for the trick or treaters we never get. So i am eating them and I like to break them in half and form one half ,with the heat of the roof of my mouth, into a small arch. Then I use my teeth to make it a candle circle. Like a glassblower of sorts",teigen
I feel like candy shouldn’t be bad for you if u suck it. what could 10 jolly melted rancher juices possibly do,teigen
I dunno they were both right next to each other,teigen

if u are judging me as a parent because my 3 year old watches kind-of-scary shit u are disrespecting my culture as an Asian American as everything good i do now is only because I think a ghost in a tree will drop a crab shell on me and I will die and be brought back as pig slop,teigen
I remember having a meeting with a men’s magazine many years ago. They said they were pivoting to video and I go hahahahahha that is so stupid. The world wants tangible magazines u idiots. I declined. That’s my story,teigen
"my vagina ripped to my asshole causing me to have one giant vagasshole but ok, guy!!!!",teigen
she likes that uncle fester is in love. I’ll stop it before his wife tries to murder him,teigen
they just tried to guillotine a baby. she said “wow that is not nice right?” the “right” part meaning she might now think it’s fine. Poor miles I’m sorry,teigen

thank u!!! I'm all over the place over here,teigen
"in what order did TLC air all these different 90 days? I'm really having difficulty navigating people's relationships. The before, the happily ever after, the regular one. do they air these in the same season? the back and forth killing me. and some just...end. sad!!",teigen

my friends said they have never seen this kind passion from me about anything. I don't know what came over me. I think I saw one picture of an apple treat and lost my mind. People were worried. it was manic-like behavior,teigen
"Saturday, I was obsessively talking about apple picking. I wouldn't shutup about it - brought it up in random conversations with friends that had nothing to do with apples. I was insane. Googling farms, sending links to people. begging, begging anyone to listen to me about apples",teigen

"Imagine eating 30 Oreos, slowly swishing them around your mouth. Reading a “found” grocery list. Calling mystery phone numbers. Reading a map. For hours. Then u read the Chris Saunt business card",teigen
ate an entire box of Oreos (for research) because they sent this giant escape room-like mystery package for their mystery flavor. Little clues all over. crying that the baker left his card in the box. Chris Saunt. this is my kind of humor. Haven’t laughed that hard in a long time,teigen

Honestly I’m not a stylish person. I would never wear a “look” to just showcase fur. I’m uncomfortable in it. So it really hurt that I was chosen for this by this man. He was extremely aggressive and trying to get a rise out of me. I wish you could hear what else he said.,teigen
You should have seen the other things he said. He only posted what made him look good. It was one of the most terrible run ins of my life. Now I’m scared to interact with people. I don’t want to be scared. I appreciate the apology. Xx,teigen

"I recently found a soda machine at the airport that lets you add flavors to different sodas. As Dr Pepper is the best soda, I made vanilla Dr Pepper. It was a delight. I have been doing some research and see that Dr Pepper vanilla float used to exist. Can we have that back",teigen
Yes,teigen

is this normal,teigen
I just went to take a picture of her and I honestly can’t find her,teigen
"I said “should I get two so they can have a friend?” And the lady said no, one will end up with a lot of bully scars. So any hamster tips are welcome",teigen
"They also said “don’t really touch her for a week. Then touch her a lot or she’ll bite you” it’s very confusing, being a hamster mom",teigen
"They told us we can feed her anything. My mom said “rice?” And they go “no, not rice”",teigen
she won’t come out from her paper dust crap stuff but she is super cute,teigen

It happens a lot. “does she ask you if certain things are okay to say?” ...it’s just very weird to me.,teigen

"you guys gotta be crazy for thinking totinos would approve an ad saying “I don’t want good pizza, I want totinos”",teigen
That’s how hyped I was though. I couldn’t wait to read the B A G,teigen
he is now claiming he truly never know they made pizzas,teigen
“nah babe they should def be on a baking sheet” oh ya think??? I no know how to cook pizza rolls,teigen
anyhow this is an actual fight now,teigen
u know when you start a story and you’re like this is gonna be great. but then it just doesn’t translate well,teigen
"I am blown away he indulged this conversation, thinking I was talking about rolls. it’s like when michael Scott was like wow Oscar thinks so little of me when he accepted his horrid gift",teigen
and that I would want tiny slices of fresh tomato on a god damn singular pizza roll,teigen
it’s pizza rolls. he has no idea totino’s makes pizza. but more importantly he thinks I am so stupid I would think tiny pizza rolls go directly onto the rack,teigen
we get the notification. John yells “it is herrrrrre!!” Like Oprah,teigen
we talk about my childhood a bit. How this pizza shaped my life no big deal,teigen
"pizza still 20 minutes out, he goes “do you want the tomato on top of it” and I was like no idiot under it yes it goes on top",teigen
For 30 minutes we have been discussing how to ensure crispness. I say it needs to be on the rack. He says no it has to go on a pan. The pizza is merely en route and I’m so madly excited about it that we are discussing how to handle its arrival,teigen
so we postmate some,teigen
He said “how many boxes do you want” and I said first of all loser it’s in a bag now,teigen
"I am having a totino’s craving. I don’t want a great pizza. I want a pizza from my childhood, with sliced fresh tomatoes on top",teigen
I told john I wouldn’t tweet this but I lied here goes,teigen
